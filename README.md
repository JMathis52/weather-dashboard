# Weather Dashboard
<!-- Badge goes here -->
## Description
[Weather Dashboard](https://jeanarose.github.io/weather-dashboard/) is a dynamic jQuery app designed to display the forecast for the current day and the next five days of a city that the user searches. The application stores the user's recently searched cities into local storage and displays them on the left-hand side. The user can simply click on the recently searched cities to view the weather for each city. Weather Dashboard utilizes the following components:
* OpenWeather APIs (Current Weather, UVI, and One Call)
* jQuery in order to display the weather dashboard dynamically and update the search history using DOM manipulation 
* AJAX in order to call the OpenWeather APIs 
* Event listeners for the search button and for the recently searched cities 
* Local storage in order to display the recently searched cities on the page

## Tests
Interested in testing Weather Dashboard? Check the following:
1. When an input is entered that is not a city and the search button is clicked, the dashboard clears and the input is not stored in the recently searched cities. 
2. When an input is entered that is a valid city, the dashboard shows the forecast for the current day and the next five days and the city is added to the top of the recently searched cities list. 
3. When a recently searched city is clicked, the city appears in the dashboard.
4. When the page is reloaded, the previously searched cities still appear, and the most recently searched city appears on the page.
